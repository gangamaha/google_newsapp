# google_newsapp
Opens the top news of the searched keyword in new tabs of your default browser

I have used Python version 2.x for this project.

Imagine opening google news in your browser searching for a keyword, pressing search button and openings all the links in the 1st page of search result to get latest update. This is exactly what this Python script does, but all in just 1 simple step.

Run the python script from your IDE or from command line python google_newsapp.py

For searching for different news, edit the keyword variable

This script is customizable to users need. For instance some people might want to read only top 10 news from search result. Just uncomment lines 53, 55 and 58 to achieve this task. Make sure that all 3 lines are uncommented properly

PS: Please feel free to open issues if you find any, the script will be altered soon to adopt to Python 3.x version too
