# google_newsapp
Opens the latest news of the searched keyword in new tabs of your default browser

I have used Python version 2.x for this project.

Imagine opening google news in your browser searching for a keyword, pressing search button and openings all the links in the 1st page of search result to get latest update. This is exactly what this Python script does, but all in just 1 simple step.

Run the python script from your IDE or from command line python google_newsapp.py

For searching for different news, edit the keyword variable

This script is customizable to users need. By default the script shows only first/top 10 news retrieved from search result. It can be modified based on needs in lines 72, 74 and 77

PS: Please feel free to open issues if you find any.
